## Welcome!

Hello, my name is Tyler Moessing. I am currently attending Brigham Young University in Provo, UT, studying Machine Learning. I love playing sports, whether it's a set of tennis, a quick game of basketball, ultimate frisbee, or pickleball. I also enjoy spending quality time with friends and family, whether it's playing board games or going on adventures.
